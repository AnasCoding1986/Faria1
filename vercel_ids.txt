To find your Vercel Organization and Project IDs:

1. Go to https://vercel.com/[your-username]/[your-project-name]/settings
2. Look for "Project ID" 
3. Look for "Team/Org ID"

Paste those values in GitHub Secrets:
- Name the Org ID secret: VERCEL_ORG_ID
- Name the Project ID secret: VERCEL_PROJECT_ID

If you can't find these, you can also get them by:
- Running 'vercel link' in the project directory
- Checking your Vercel dashboard project settings
